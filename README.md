# Shopping_cart mini project Documentation
Overview The shopping cart mini project is desigined with reference of ecommerce websites like flipkart,amazon,meesho etc, by using this shoping cart we can add items,delete items,update items,view the items present in cart and also calculate the total price of the items.

Technologies used:

I have used the python3 version for the prepartion of cart codeing.This is the back end part of the eccomerce websites but here we not include the address and payment option in this mini project.
By using this cart the user can add any number 0f items in the cart and if the user want to remove any of the items they can remove from cart and also update one item with another item and they also know the total amount they want to pay for the items stored in the cart according to their quantity. 



Conclusion:By using the cart mini project the customer simply know the total amount that they want to pay and they can also check the items in the cart.
